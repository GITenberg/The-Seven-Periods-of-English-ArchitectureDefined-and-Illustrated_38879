<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>"We have been so long accustomed to speak of our National Architecture
in the terms, and according to the classification bequeathed to us by
Mr. Rickman, and those terms and that classification are so well
understood and have been so universally adopted, that any proposal to
supersede the one, or to modify the other, requires somewhat more than
a mere apology. To disturb a Nomenclature of long standing, to set
aside terms in familiar use, and to set up others in their place which
are strange, and therefore at first unintelligible, involves an
interruption of that facility with which we are accustomed to
communicate with one another on any given subject, that is only to be
justified by reasons of a cogent and satisfactory nature.</p>

<p>"The sufficiency of Mr. Rickman's Nomenclature and Divisions, and their
suitableness at the time and for the purpose for which they were made,
are best evidenced by the fact that, although the attempts to supersede
them have been both numerous and persevering, they have remained for
nearly half a century the principal guide to the Architectural Student;
and Mr. Rickman's 'Attempt to discriminate the Styles of Architecture
in England,' is still the Text-book from which the greater part of the
popular works of the present day have been compiled.</p>

<p>"In referring, however, to these attempts to supersede Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span> Rickman's
system, it is proper to remark that one observation applies to the
whole of them;&mdash;although they propose to change the Nomenclature of his
different styles, or to subdivide them, his main division of English
Architecture into four great Periods or Styles, is adopted by all, and
still remains undisturbed. No point, therefore, has been hitherto
proposed to be gained by these alterations, beyond a change of name;
and this may be taken as a sufficient reason why none of these attempts
have been successful: men are not willing to unlearn a term with which
they are familiar, however inappropriate, in order to learn another,
which, after all, means the same thing.</p>

<p>"Although, however, Mr. Rickman's simple division of Church
Architecture into four Periods, or Styles, may perhaps have been the
one best suited to his time, and to the elementary state of the
knowledge of the subject possessed by the best informed Archæologists
of his day, it may with propriety be questioned how far such a division
is suited to the exigencies of writers of the present day, or to the
present advanced tastes of knowledge on the subject.</p>

<p>"Simplicity was doubtless the object Mr. Rickman had in view in his
division of English Architecture into four Styles only. This is a
recommendation, however, which can hardly be said to hold good at the
present day: it behoves us to consider well, perhaps more especially at
the present moment, whether Mr. Rickman's system fulfils all the
conditions essential to one calculated for popular and universal use;
and whether we should therefore seek to confirm and to perpetuate it,
or whether the time has not arrived for the adoption of a more detailed
and accurate division of the long and noble series of buildings which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
contain the History of our National Architecture from the Heptarchy to
the Reformation."<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>No one can enter into an inquiry of this kind without eventually coming
to the conclusion that there are two large classes of Buildings
containing distinctive marks of peculiarity of character, which find no
place in Mr. Rickman's system, but which nevertheless, from the number
and importance of their examples, are pre-eminently entitled to
separate classification. These two classes are those to which the
buildings enumerated at pp. <a href="#Page_24">24</a>, and <a href="#Page_31">31</a>, <a href="#Page_32">32</a> respectively belong, and
which cannot, without circumlocution, be described in any of the terms
prescribed by Mr. Rickman.</p>

<p>As regards the earlier of these two classes, the extent to which these
distinctive peculiarities of detail exist, will perhaps at first
scarcely be credited, and proofs of a much more extensive and
satisfactory character than are contained in the following pages, or
could be looked for in an elementary work of this nature, will probably
be required before its title to separate classification will be
universally conceded.</p>

<p>As regards the later of these classes, the same difficulty does not
exist. Mr. Rickman divided the whole of the buildings of Pointed
Architecture into three Styles or Classes, which he denominated "Early
English," "Decorated," "Perpendicular." The titles of the two last he
professed to derive from the character of their windows, conceiving, no
doubt justly, that no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span> part of a Gothic building exhibits peculiarities
of Style in so prominent and characteristic a manner as its windows. In
strict accordance with this rule, which may be assumed to be a correct
and valuable one, it has already been shown,<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> that had Mr. Rickman
gone a step further and classed the whole of the buildings of Pointed
Architecture according to the forms of their Windows under <i>four</i>
heads, instead of <i>three</i>, he would have obtained a classification
equally simple, but more intelligible and convenient; he would have
obviated much that is confused and indefinite, and therefore perplexing
to the Architectural Student, in his description of buildings which
belong to the class to which we are now referring, and would have
enabled us to compare the buildings of our own Country with those of
corresponding character, and nearly contemporaneous date on the
Continent, in a manner that would have established an analogy between
them, which, according to the present classification, has no apparent
existence.</p>

<p>The inability to describe, or speak of any of the buildings belonging
to either of these two classes, including some of the finest in the
kingdom, otherwise than as examples of an intermediate and anomalous
character, exhibiting the peculiarities partly of one style and partly
of another, but belonging specifically to neither, must be admitted to
be a serious defect in all hitherto recognised systems of Architectural
Nomenclature; and there are probably few Architecturalists who have not
frequently felt the inconvenience arising from the want of more
explicit and definite terms than at present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span> exist, by means of which
to describe the buildings of these two classes.</p>

<p>It is to remedy these defects, and to provide for this want, that the
following division of the History of our National Architecture into
Seven Periods instead of Four, is now formally proposed, under the
belief that some such Division as this, by whatever terms it may be
characterised, will sooner or later force itself into universal
adoption. With respect to the terms themselves it would be unreasonable
to expect the same unanimity; the following considerations, however,
would seem to bring their selection within narrow limits. It would
appear, in the first place, unadvisable to designate any of the later
Periods, except the last, by any of the terms hitherto in use, as
tending probably to confusion and misapprehension, from the difficulty
of limiting their signification to the extent proposed in the minds of
those who have been accustomed to use them in a more ample sense: and
to retain the last, if the others be abandoned, and a more appropriate
or analogous term can be found, appears to be still less desirable.</p>

<p>At the same time it is much to be desired that the terms we use should
be not altogether strange, and, if possible, self-explanatory. These
two conditions are such as to render it difficult to find terms such as
to be in all respects perfectly satisfactory; and perhaps no system of
Nomenclature could be found so perfect as to be entirely free from
objection.</p>

<p>The reasons which have caused the adoption of the terms made use of in
the following system, are fully given in their proper place, and it
only remains for the Author to notice that the terms "Curvilinear" and
"Rectilinear" were first proposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span> by a writer in the "British Critic,"
some years ago, as a substitute for Mr. Rickman's terms "Decorated" and
"Perpendicular;" and in a sense, therefore, as regards the former of
these terms, essentially different from that in which it is here
proposed to be applied. The rest must be more or less familiar to all
who have been of late engaged in the study.</p>

<p>The Author desires to take this opportunity of acknowledging his
obligations to Mr. T. Austin, by whom all the subjects, with one
exception, have been measured and drawn from the buildings themselves;
as well as to Mr. G. B. Smith, by whom the whole have been engraved on
steel, for the accuracy and appearance of the principal illustrations.</p>

INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>To present at a single glance a comprehensive view of the History of
English Church Architecture from the Heptarchy to the Reformation, and
to do this in a manner, which, without taxing too seriously the memory
of the student, may enable him to fix in his mind the limits, and the
general outline of the inquiry he is about to enter upon, is the object
of the present treatise.</p>

<p>Instead therefore of entering, as is usual in elementary works of this
nature, into a detailed account of all the parts of an Ecclesiastical
structure, a certain portion only of such a building has for this
purpose been selected, and so exhibited in the garb in which it
appeared at successive intervals of time, as to present to the reader a
means of comparison that will enable him readily to apprehend the
gradual change of form through which it passed from the Eleventh to the
Sixteenth Centuries, and at once to recognise the leading
characteristics of the several Periods into which it is here proposed
to divide the History of our National Architecture. Having thus fixed
these leading characteristics in his mind, he will then be in a
condition to follow us hereafter, if he pleases, into the detail of the
whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> subject, and to become familiar with those niceties of
distinction, the detection of which&mdash;escaping, as they do, the eye of
the general observer&mdash;contributes so materially to the enjoyment of the
study, and a perfect acquaintance with which is so absolutely essential
to a correct understanding of the true History of the Art.</p>

<p>That this mode of approaching the study of this subject is a convenient
one, will probably be admitted by those who may remember the
difficulties they encountered, in their early attempts to acquire a
general conception of the scheme of the History of Church Architecture,
as given in most of the manuals now in use; and the complexity of
detail in which they found themselves immediately involved on the very
threshold of their inquiry.</p>

<p>It has been the practice in most elementary works on Church
Architecture to derive the illustrations of the subject, indifferently
from the smaller and the larger buildings of the Kingdom; and by
implication to assign an equal authority to both. It will be readily
admitted, however, that the History of an Art is to be gathered from
its principal Monuments, and not from those the design or execution of
which may have been entrusted to other than the ablest masters of the
Period: in the choice, therefore, of the examples which have been
selected to illustrate the series of changes which are described in the
following pages, reference has been made principally to the great
Cathedral, Abbey, and Collegiate Churches of the Kingdom, and
occasionally only to some of the larger Parish Churches whose size or
importance would seem to bring them under the above denomination.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.<br /><br />

CLASSIFICATION.</h2>


<p>Church Architecture in England, from its earliest existence down to the
Sixteenth Century, was in a state of constant progress, or transition,
and this progress appears to have been carried on, with certain
exceptions in different parts of the country, very nearly
simultaneously. It follows from this circumstance, first, That it is
impossible to divide our National Architecture correctly into any
number of distinct <i>Orders</i> or <i>Styles</i>; and secondly, That any
Division of its History into a given number of <i>Periods</i>, must
necessarily be an arbitrary one. It is nevertheless absolutely
essential for the purpose of conveniently describing the long series of
noble monuments which remain to us, that we should adopt some system of
chronological arrangement, which may enable us to group, and to
classify them in a distinct and intelligible manner: and although no
broad lines of demarcation in this connected series are discernible&mdash;so
gradual was the change&mdash;yet so rapid and so complete was it also, that
a period of fifty years did not elapse without a material alteration in
the form and fashion of every detail of a building.</p>

<p>Now it will be readily conceived that, even in the midst of this
continual change, certain favourite forms would remain in use longer
than others; and that this circumstance may possibly afford us the
opportunity of which we are in search; and enable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> us in the adoption
of any such arbitrary Division so to define and to characterise the
Architecture of its different Periods, as to render this Historical
Survey and our future descriptions sufficiently intelligible.</p>

<p>One principal Division of Church Architecture has been recognised and
adopted by all who have studied and written on the subject; that,
namely, which separates Ecclesiastical Buildings into two classes, in
the first or earlier of which the <i>circular arch</i> was exclusively
employed; and in the second or later, the <i>pointed arch</i> alone was
used. To the former of these two Classes, the term <span class="smcap">Romanesque</span> has been
given, and to the latter, the term <span class="smcap">Gothic</span>.</p>

<p>This division is so simple, and at the same time so strongly marked,
that without entering into a discussion as to the value or propriety of
the terms themselves, and contenting ourselves with the fact that they
are already in general use, we can have little hesitation in adopting
this primary division as the groundwork of our system.</p>

<p>At the same time, it is manifest, that, for purposes of description, it
is not sufficiently minute; and that a further subdivision is
necessary: it is also clear, that it excludes a large class of
buildings that were erected during the period which intervened between
the first appearance of the pointed arch, and the final disappearance
of the circular arch.</p>

<p>As regards the buildings of the Romanesque Period, no subdivision of
them can be more satisfactory than that which has already been for some
time in use, and which divides them into those which were built before
and after the Conquest, and designates them accordingly <span class="smcap">Saxon</span> and
<span class="smcap">Norman</span>.</p>

<p>As regards the buildings of that Intermediate Period just mentioned, to
none can the term <span class="smcap">Transitional</span> so aptly be applied as to those erected
under influences created by that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> remarkable contest between two great
antagonistic principles, which, after having been carried on for a
period of nearly fifty years, terminated in a complete revolution in
the style of building at the end of the Twelfth Century.</p>

<p>Lastly, as regards the Gothic Period, no subdivision of it appears to
be so natural and convenient, as that which is suggested by the four
principal changes of form through which the Window passed from the
Thirteenth to the Fifteenth Centuries.</p>

<p>These changes have been fully illustrated by the author in a former
work,<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> and will be therefore only briefly recapitulated here.</p>

<p>For half a century or more, after the disappearance of the circular
arch, the window appeared under a form, which from its general
resemblance to a <i>lancet</i>, in its length, breadth, and principal
proportions, rather than from any uniform acuteness in the shape of its
head, led to the universal application of that term to all the windows
of this Period. This observation applies equally to the window whether
used singly, or in groups of two, three, five, or seven; and equally
also to the later as to the earlier examples of this Period.</p>

<span class="caption">TEMPLE CHURCH.</span>
</div>

<p>It is proposed therefore to denominate this the <small>LANCET PERIOD</small> of Gothic
Architecture.</p>

<p>Towards the close of this Period the practice of combining a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> plurality
of Lancets, under one arch, or hood-moulding&mdash;and of piercing the solid
spaces that intervened between the heads of these lancets and the
underside of this arch in various ornamental ways, became common; by
the adoption of which, a group of several lancets was converted into a
single window of several lights. Out of this practice arose a novel and
beautiful discovery; this was the invention of <i>Tracery</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 461px;">
<a name="croft" id="croft"></a>
<img src="images/i_021.jpg" width="461" height="400" alt="CROFT." title="CROFT." />
<span class="caption">CROFT.</span>
</div>

<p>For nearly three-quarters of a century after its introduction the
Tracery of windows contained forms in which that simplest of all
Geometrical figures, the <i>Circle</i>, was principally conspicuous: and
although, in the latter part of this Period, the Circle does not obtain
the same prominent place, in the centre of the window-head, and as the
principal feature of the design, that is generally allotted to it in
the earlier examples, yet the important part that it bears in the
construction of the design of even the whole of these later examples,
fully justifies the application of the term, already pretty generally
in use, to this class of windows; and entitles us to call this Period
after that figure, and "par excellence," the <small>GEOMETRICAL PERIOD</small>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 432px;">
<img src="images/i_021b.jpg" width="432" height="400" alt="HOWDEN." title="HOWDEN." />
<span class="caption">HOWDEN.</span>
</div>

<p>At the close of this Period a feature began to make its way into the
subordinate parts of the tracery, which had already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> shown itself for
some time previously in the mouldings, and which eventually exercised a
most important influence on the Architecture of the next half-century.</p>

<p>This feature is the curve which mathematicians call the <i>curve of
contra-flexure</i>, and which is known amongst architecturalists as the
<i>Ogee</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 449px;">
<a name="wilsford" id="wilsford"></a>
<img src="images/i_022a.jpg" width="449" height="400" alt="WILSFORD." title="WILSFORD." />
<span class="caption">WILSFORD.</span>
</div>

<p>The flowing nature of this curve imparted to the Tracery a grace and an
ease which the rigid outline of the Circle denied it: and affords us a
strong point of contrast whereby to distinguish the Architecture of the
two Periods. The sinuosity of form which characterises the tracery,
pervades also the mouldings, the carved work, and all the details of
this Period, and enables us to designate it appropriately as the
<small>CURVILINEAR PERIOD</small>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 462px;">
<a name="winchester" id="winchester"></a>
<img src="images/i_022b.jpg" width="462" height="400" alt="WINCHESTER." title="WINCHESTER." />
<span class="caption">WINCHESTER.</span>
</div>

<p>In the latter part of this Period, a horizontal bar, or <i>transom</i>, as
it is called, was occasionally used in the lower part of the window.
Whether this bar was introduced for the purpose of strengthening the
mullions, or for the sake of proportion, it speedily grew into frequent
use. At the same time also vertical lines presented themselves
occasionally in the Tracery; a new principle, in fact, had made its
appearance, which rapidly overran not only the windows, but the
doorways, the arcades, and every part of the building. The straight
line,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> when once introduced, quickly superseded the curved line; square
panels covered the walls; angularity of form pervaded even the
mouldings and minor details, and to the round finish, the square edge
was preferred.</p>

<p>This, the last of the four Periods of Gothic Architecture which
extended over a term of nearly two Centuries, we propose accordingly to
call the <small>RECTILINEAR PERIOD</small>.</p>

<p>The History of our National Architecture will thus be divided into
Seven Periods, the order and duration of which are as follows:&mdash;</p>

EXTERIOR AND INTERIOR COMPARTMENTS.</h2>


<p>The most perfect type of a church built in England, during the best
ages of Church Architecture, may be said to contain the following
essentials:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The Ground Plan is after the form of the Latin Cross, and is
divisible <i>longitudinally</i> into three portions; namely,</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="smcap">The Choir</span>,</li>
<li><span class="smcap">The Transepts</span>,</li>
<li><span class="smcap">The Nave</span>.</li>
</ul>

<p>2. The Choir and the Nave, and occasionally the Transepts, are divided,
by means of columns and arches, <i>transversely</i> into three portions,
consisting of the</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="smcap">Centre Aisle</span>,</li>
<li><span class="smcap">North Aisle</span>,</li>
<li><span class="smcap">South Aisle</span>.</li>
</ul>

<p>3. The <span class="smcap">Main Wall</span> of each of the first-mentioned separate portions of
the building is divisible, in the interior <i>vertically</i> into three
portions, or Stories, consisting of</p>


<ul>
<li><span class="smcap">The Ground-story</span>,</li>
<li><span class="smcap">The Triforium or Blind-story</span>,</li>
<li><span class="smcap">The Clere-story</span>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Now on viewing any of these Main Walls of a building, whether on the
inside, or the outside, it will be at once seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> that they consist, in
their entire length, of a series of single and separate portions, or
<i>Compartments</i>, tied together, and connected by the horizontal lines,
or String courses, which traverse them from end to end; and that each
of these single Compartments embodies within itself the spirit of the
whole design, and may be said to represent, individually, the <small>MAIN IDEA</small>
of the Building.</p>

<p>It is this portion of such a building then&mdash;a single Compartment of the
Exterior and Interior of the Main Walls of the Choir or Nave, and its
adjacent Aisle&mdash;that we have selected for the purpose of instituting
that comparison which will enable us to fix and define the
characteristics of the Seven Periods of English Architecture.</p>

<p>Neglecting, therefore, for the present, the Gable Ends, the Towers and
Turrets, the Porches, the Doorways, the Chapels, the Cloisters, and all
the other adjuncts of an Ecclesiastical Building, and bestowing our
entire attention upon these Exterior and Interior Compartments, we will
proceed at once to a comparison of their several parts, and consider in
order the mode of treatment they received at the hands of the builders,
of each of these Seven Periods, commencing with the earliest and
descending to the latest.</p>

THE SAXON PERIOD.</h2>
<hr class="r5" />

<p class="center"><b>A.D. &mdash;&mdash; TO A.D. 1066.</b></p>


<p>Inasmuch as there does not remain to us a single Exterior or Interior
Compartment in any Cathedral or Conventual Church of genuine Saxon
Architecture, the comparative illustration of this Period is rendered
impossible.</p>

<p>A few Piers and Arches exist indeed, in all probability, in the
Churches of <span class="smcap">Brixworth</span> in Northamptonshire, St. Michael's at <span class="smcap">St. Albans</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Repton</span> in Derbyshire; but they differ considerably in their
character from one another, and as widely probably in their date. We
have also a few Chancel and Tower arches left, which appear to belong
to this Period; as well as some singular and interesting Towers, a few
Doorways and Windows, and some considerable portions of masonry.
Altogether, however, these remains are not such as to enable us to
define, with any degree of certainty, the nature and character of the
<i>Main Walls</i> of a Saxon Cathedral, and are, therefore, not available
for our present purpose.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.<br /><br />

NORMAN PERIOD.</h2>
<hr class="r5" />

<h3>PRINCIPAL CHARACTERISTIC.</h3>

<p class="center">THE UNIVERSAL USE OF THE CIRCULAR ARCH IN EVERY PART OF A BUILDING
THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE PERIOD.</p>


<h4><i>Exterior Compartment.</i></h4>

<p>The walls of a Norman building are usually strong and massive, and
built of small stones. They have a plain <span class="smcap">Base-course</span>, of little
projection, and are generally finished above with a <span class="smcap">Corbel-table</span>,
consisting sometimes of a series of small arches, on rude heads, and
sometimes of a projecting horizontal table resting on a series of
rudely sculptured blocks. Upon this Corbel-table is a plain <small>PARAPET</small> and
<small>COPING</small> where these are left, which is rarely the case.</p>

<p>The compartments are divided by a shallow <span class="smcap">Buttress</span> or <span class="smcap">Pilaster Strip</span>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Windows</span> are low and broad, and have usually a single shaft set in
an angular recess, carrying a cubical capital and a single roll.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">String-courses</span>, when not plain, have frequently indented ornaments
of different kinds&mdash;such as the <i>billet</i>, the <i>saw-tooth</i>, the <i>star</i>,
and the <i>chevron</i>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Clere-story Windows</span>, in the larger and richer buildings, are
usually placed in an arcade, consisting of three or more arches, of
which the centre one, filled by the window, is the largest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>
<h4><i>Interior Compartment.</i></h4>

<p>The proportions of the interior are invariably heavy and massive.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Piers</span> consist either of a stout cylindrical column, or of a
rectangular mass, having semicircular shafts attached to its different
faces. They are sometimes, when circular, scored and ornamented with
zig-zag, spiral, and other mouldings.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Capitals</span> are formed of a cubical block, rounded off on the lower
side from the square to the circle, and are ordinarily of a heavy
cumbrous character, and sometimes ornamented with rude sculpture of
leaves and animals, carved in slight relief on the surface of the
block.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Pier-arches</span>, in early examples, are perfectly plain, and square
edged, without mouldings or ornament; but more frequently they carry
one or more heavy rolls on the angle of each order of the arch; and are
often ornamented richly with concentric rows of chevron, billet, and
other Norman ornaments.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Vaulting</span> or <span class="smcap">Roof-shaft</span> is usually a semicircular shaft rising from
the floor&mdash;on the face of every alternate Pier&mdash;to the springing of the
vault or roof.</p>

<p>In the earlier buildings the <span class="smcap">Triforium</span> is generally occupied by one
large arch, of somewhat less span and height than the pier-arch: but in
the later examples, this arch is generally subdivided into two, and
later still, into four small arches, carried on single shafts; the
capitals, arch-mouldings, and other details, being all on a smaller
scale, but of similar character, to those of the Ground-story.</p>

<p>In most Norman buildings of large size, the Triforium forms a very
important part of the design of the Interior.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Clere-story</span> in nearly all large buildings carries a gallery made in
the thickness of the wall, which passes between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> Clere-story Window
and the inner face of the <i>Main Wall</i>. This inner face is accordingly
carried on one or more arches. In Norman buildings, this Clere-story
arcade usually consists of three arches, of which the middle one is the
largest, and corresponds with the window. In some examples, this middle
arch is stilted above the others, by being lifted on a second small
shaft on each side, standing on the lower one which carries the side
arches.</p>

<p>In almost all buildings of importance, an <span class="smcap">Arcade</span> is carried along the
walls of the Church below the side-aisle windows. In Norman buildings
this usually consists of a series of single or intersecting circular
arches, resting on small cushion capitals on single shafts.</p>

<p>The side-aisles are usually covered with a plain circular quadripartite
<span class="smcap">Vault</span>, having sometimes a diagonal rib, as well as a transverse band,
moulded with single roll mouldings.</p>

TRANSITIONAL PERIOD.</h2>
<hr class="r5" />

<h3>PRINCIPAL CHARACTERISTIC.</h3>

<p class="center">THE CONTEMPORANEOUS USE, IN THE SAME BUILDING, OF CIRCULAR AND POINTED
ARCHES.</p>


<h4><i>Exterior Compartment.</i></h4>

<p>On the outside the usual prevalence of the circular arch in the <span class="smcap">Windows</span>
and <span class="smcap">Doorways</span>, gives still a Norman character to the building; but the
<span class="smcap">Base-course</span> and <span class="smcap">Buttresses</span> begin to show greater projection, and the
walls are lightened in proportion.</p>

<p>The invariable Billet moulding disappears from the <span class="smcap">String-courses</span>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Windows</span> are more elongated in form, and have lighter shafts.</p>

<p>The circular <span class="smcap">Corbel-table</span> gives place to a regularly moulded <span class="smcap">Cornice</span>,
carried on a series of blocks of uniform profile; and a sloped <span class="smcap">Coping</span>
covers the <span class="smcap">Parapet</span>.</p>

<p>In some of the latest examples indeed, the <span class="smcap">Buttresses</span> have <span class="smcap">Set-offs</span>,
and, rising above the parapet, have also a pyramidal Capping.</p>

<p>An increasing lightness of proportion is perceptible in all parts of
the buildings of this Period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>
<h4><i>Interior Compartment.</i></h4>

<p>Except in the earliest examples of this Period, the heavy cylindrical
column disappears; and the <span class="smcap">Pier</span> consists of a lighter mass of
semicircular shafts, and square edges; occasionally also, a shaft
having a pear-shaped section is substituted for the semicircular shaft.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Capitals</span> consist still of a square block, moulded down to the
circular form below; with this difference, however, that the lower part
of the capital is hollowed down to the circle, instead of being left as
in the Norman Period, full and round; the latter showing a <i>convex</i>,
and the former a <i>concave</i> profile. Both the larger and the smaller
Capitals have also very frequently an ornament peculiar to the Period,
which consists of a small volute, forming the curled end of a plain
leaf, which enfolds the bell of the Capital. This volute may be looked
upon as one of the most characteristic features of the Period. The
abacus of the capital is invariably square in plan, and has its upper
edge (except in a few of the latest examples) also square in section.</p>

<p>In the later buildings of the Period, foliage, exhibiting considerable
freedom of design, is occasionally to be seen.</p>

<p>The <i>Pointed Arch</i> first made its appearance in the Transitional
Period; in the earlier buildings it is used in the <i>Arches of
Construction</i> only, or those constituting the framework of the
building, such as the Pier-arches and the Arches of the Vaulting, and
of the Crossing; whilst the Circular Arch is used in the <i>Arches of
Decoration</i> only, or those which may be said to constitute the
panel-work, such as the windows, the arcades, the doorways, and such
like. In the later buildings of the Period, however, the Pointed Arch
is frequently found in some of the smaller arches also.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Pier-arches</span>, therefore, are almost invariably pointed, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> the
earlier examples obtusely, and in the later examples often acutely; the
mouldings, which have become much lighter, are few and plain; carrying
usually a roll, or a pear-shaped moulding, at the angle of each order
of the arch: they frequently have no <span class="smcap">Hood-moulding</span>. All the usual rich
ornaments of the Norman Style disappear, but the Chevron occurs
occasionally, and another ornamental moulding somewhat resembling it,
but peculiar to this Period, is frequently seen.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">String-courses</span> do not usually carry any ornament, and have commonly
a simple section peculiar to the Period.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Vaulting</span> or <span class="smcap">Roof-shaft</span> has usually a pear-shaped section.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Triforium-arcade</span> has usually Circular Arches, but in the later
examples the two forms of arch are frequently intermixed. The Shafts
are of a much lighter character, and carry arches of simple mouldings.</p>

<p>The Pointed Arch, if found anywhere in the arches of Decoration, is
generally to be seen in the <span class="smcap">Clere-story</span>, the highest part of the
building, and consequently the latest in point of construction.</p>

<p>Plain pointed quadripartite <span class="smcap">Vaulting</span> not unfrequently covers the
side-aisles, and sometimes the centre-aisle.</p>

<p>The contrast presented by the discriminate use of the two forms of arch
before mentioned, is sometimes strikingly exhibited in the side-aisles,
where it is by no means uncommon to find a large plain circular window
placed immediately under an acutely pointed wall rib, forming part of
the contemporaneous pointed <span class="smcap">Vaulting</span> of the side-aisle.</p>

LANCET PERIOD.</h2>
<hr class="r5" />

<h3>PRINCIPAL CHARACTERISTIC.</h3>

<p class="center">THE LANCET WINDOW USED SINGLY, IN COUPLETS AND TRIPLETS, AND ARRANGED
IN GROUPS OF FOUR, FIVE, AND SEVEN.</p>


<h4><i>Exterior Compartment.</i></h4>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Buttresses</span> have considerable projection, are divided into stages,
and have usually a plain pyramidal capping, and sometimes a plain
pinnacle.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Base-course</span> Has also more projection and importance, and its upper
members are frequently moulded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flying-buttresses</span> often span the roof of the side-aisle to support the
main vaulting.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Windows</span> in the earliest examples stand alone as single windows;
they are also sometimes placed singly in a continuous arcade; later
still in triplets under one arch, the centre one being the tallest, and
in some instances two lancets are coupled under one arch,&mdash;the spandrel
between them being frequently pierced with a quatrefoil, or other
opening.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Parapet</span> has occasionally sunk ornaments upon it, and is carried by
a cornice having a few deep mouldings, with a flower, or other ornament
at intervals, or by a trefoiled Corbel-table, or by a series of
blocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>
<h4><i>Interior Compartment.</i></h4>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Piers</span> consist most commonly of a cluster of shafts, disposed in a
circular form. These shafts sometimes stand entirely free, and surround
a large circular or octagonal column, and are banded in the middle.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Capitals</span> have sometimes one or two rows of stiff projecting leaves,
of a bulbous form, which appear to grow out of the neck of the capital,
and sometimes a single or double series of minute deeply cut mouldings;
the square form of capital, both in the plan and in the upper edge of
the abacus, entirely disappears.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Bases</span> consist almost invariably of a deep small hollow, set between
two rounds, standing on a square-edged plinth; and greatly resemble the
ordinary Attic base.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Pier-arches</span> usually show three orders, of small deeply cut
mouldings of alternate rounds and hollows, the number and depth of
which give an exceedingly rich and characteristic appearance to all the
arches of this Period. The peculiar ornament called the <i>dog-tooth</i>,
which is formed by hollowing out the sides of a series of contiguous
pyramids notched out of an angular projection, occurs constantly in the
arch-mouldings, as well as in almost every other part of buildings
where an opportunity of carving it presents itself.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Hood-moulding</span>, resting on small and elegant heads or bosses, is an
almost invariable accompaniment of arches of every description.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Vaulting-shaft</span> sometimes rises from the floor in front of the
principal Pier,&mdash;but more usually from a corbel-shaft, resting on a
large ornamental corbel, placed immediately over the pier; it consists
generally of a triple cluster of small elegant shafts, with hollows
between them.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Triforium-arch</span> generally covers two smaller arches; but
occasionally, a pair of principal Triforium-arches cover two pair of
subordinate arches, which are sometimes plain, and sometimes trefoiled;
the spandrel wall above them being ornamented with foliage, or a sunk
trefoil, and sometimes pierced through with a quatrefoil or other
opening. Sometimes, indeed, one large primary arch covers two secondary
arches, which again contain two small tertiary arches; thus fully
developing the principle of subordination in this part of the building.</p>

<p>The principal <span class="smcap">Triforium-piers</span> generally exhibit a row of light shafts
on the face of a solid pier, carrying arch-mouldings of three orders,
and separated sometimes by a line of dog-tooth moulding, or stiff
foliage.</p>

<p>The <i>secondary piers</i> are usually single, double, or triple detached
shafts, carrying the smaller arches.</p>

<p>Where the Triforium contains three orders of piers, the <i>tertiary pier</i>
consists of a single shaft only, carrying the third order of
arch-mouldings.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Vaulting-shaft</span> usually terminates in an elegant capital, just below
the Clerestory-string, the mouldings of which form in that case the
impost mouldings of the capital. The <span class="smcap">Arcade</span> generally corresponds with
the windows, and consists either of a row of continuous arches, of
equal height, or, as is commonly the case, of three tall arches carried
on a triple shaft, of which the centre one is the loftiest: the
mouldings and ornaments being similar to those of the rest of the
building.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Vaulting</span> is generally simple, and acute, and usually of the
quadripartite or sexpartite form.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Aisle-arcade</span> consists generally of a series of plain, or
trefoil-headed arches on single shafts, carrying the usual mouldings
and ornaments.</p>

GEOMETRICAL PERIOD.</h2>
<hr class="r5" />

<h3>PRINCIPAL CHARACTERISTIC</h3>

<p class="center">SIMPLE GEOMETRICAL TRACERY IN THE HEADS OF THE WINDOWS, IN PANELS AND
IN ARCADES.</p>


<h4><i>Exterior Compartment.</i></h4>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Buttresses</span> have frequently set-offs, and canopies attached to their
faces, carrying often a series of <span class="smcap">Crockets</span>: these in the earlier
examples are plain, stiff, and curled; but the later ones are formed by
a gracefully disposed leaf. Towards the end of the Period, the
buttresses became very bulky and massive, and carried little or no
ornaments.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Pinnacles</span> have often the same ornament, and are crowned with
finials composed of a bunch of foliage.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Cornice</span> often carries a large ornamental leaf in its hollow, and
the projecting Corbel-table is no longer seen.</p>

<p>The earlier <span class="smcap">Windows</span> exhibit tracery which consists almost exclusively
of plain foliated circles; but in the later examples other simple
geometrical forms were employed. The heads of the window lights,
occasionally plain, were more frequently, even in the earlier examples,
and invariably in the later ones, cusped or foliated.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Clere-story</span> usually contains a single window, or at most a pair,
containing tracery similar to that of the side-aisle windows, and the
Clere-story arcade altogether disappears.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Cornice</span> is usually similar to that of the side-aisles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>
<h4><i>Interior Compartment.</i></h4>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Piers</span> have occasionally, in the earlier examples, detached shafts;
but they more usually consist of a solid mass of engaged shafts,
separated by hollow mouldings, and disposed on the plan of a spherical
triangle.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Bases</span> consist generally of a triple roll, standing on the usual
plinth; and the <span class="smcap">Capitals</span> carry foliage disposed much more freely and
gracefully than in the preceding Period, and frequently of exquisite
design.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Pier-arches</span> have usually mouldings in three orders of very elegant
profile, not so deeply cut, however, as in the Lancet Period: the
favourite dog-tooth is nowhere seen, but late in the period a
substitute for it was found in the ornament called the <i>Ball-flower</i>.</p>

<p>All <span class="smcap">Bosses</span>, <span class="smcap">Figures</span>, and <span class="smcap">Sculptures</span> of every kind are carved in the
very best manner; and all <span class="smcap">String-courses</span> and <span class="smcap">Hood-mouldings</span> are moulded
with the greatest care and elegance; indeed the art of carving in stone
may be said to have attained its greatest perfection during this
Period.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Triforium</span> in the earlier examples commonly contains a pair of
double arches, carrying circular tracery in their heads: in the later
examples, it becomes greatly reduced in size and prominence, and is
made entirely subordinate to the Clere-story; and consists often of a
low foliated arcade, or a band of plain tracery.</p>

<p>The inner arcade of the <span class="smcap">Clere-story</span> altogether disappears, and in its
place is sometimes found a plane of Geometrical Tracery, corresponding
with that of the window; but more commonly a single arch spans the
entire compartment; and sometimes the gallery is dispensed with
altogether.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Aisle-arcade</span> is often very elegant; the arches are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> usually
foliated, and covered with a straight-sided canopy. Occasionally this
arcade consists of a series of beautiful panels containing geometrical
tracery, with mouldings of a very minute and elegant character.</p>

<p>Both the centre and side-aisles are generally covered with <span class="smcap">Vaulting</span> of
simple form, having characteristic bosses and rib-mouldings.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br /><br />

CURVILINEAR PERIOD.</h2>
<hr class="r5" />

<h3>PRINCIPAL CHARACTERISTIC.</h3>

<p class="center">FLOWING TRACERY IN THE WINDOWS, AND THE PREVALENCE OF THE OGEE CURVE IN
ALL THE DETAILS.</p>


<h4><i>Exterior Compartment.</i></h4>

<p>As the Circle characterises the previous Period, so the Ogee marks the
present Period. It is found not only in the principal outline of the
tracery, but also in its smaller subdivisions; not only in the profiles
of the mouldings, but also in the contour of the foliage and carved
work.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Windows</span> are the most important features in the Churches of this
Period. In the more important buildings they are frequently of great
size and elaborate design, and in the smaller buildings, the rest of
the work seems often to have been impoverished for the sake of the
Windows.</p>

<p>The infinite variety of design that is contained in the Tracery of this
Period is very remarkable, and distinguishes its Architecture, in a
manner not to be mistaken, from that of other nations during the same
Period.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Base-course</span> carries a series of mouldings in which the Ogee profile
is almost invariably found. The <span class="smcap">String-courses</span>, <span class="smcap">Hood-mouldings</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Set-offs</span> exhibit it also.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Buttresses</span> are usually divided into a greater number of equal
stages; their canopies, and those of their pinnacles, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> invariably
richly crocketed, and have usually the Ogee form instead of the
straight pedimental finish.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Cornice</span> carries usually a row of large square pateras of foliage,
in a shallow hollow, and is often surmounted with a battlement, or a
parapet pierced or panelled with a flowing trefoil or a quatrefoil.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Ball-flower</span> which appeared at the end of the previous Period,
became a favourite ornament for a short time in the commencement of
this Period.</p>


<h4><i>Interior Compartment.</i></h4>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Piers</span> are usually disposed in plan in the form of a diamond; and
consist generally of four shafts with intervening hollows. The <span class="smcap">Bases</span>
and <span class="smcap">Capitals</span> are not unfrequently octagonal in form; and the foliage of
the latter consists of crumpled leaves, not growing out of the neck of
the capital, as in the earlier Periods, but apparently attached to it,
or bound round it.</p>

<p>The mouldings of the <span class="smcap">Pier-arches</span> are fewer in number; they are
shallower than those of the preceding Period, and often contain the
double Ogee; the walls being thinner, the arches frequently carry, in
this Period, as well as in the following one, only two orders of
mouldings instead of three. The small square patera, consisting of four
leaves, is a common ornament of the Period, and all the foliage is
formed of peculiar crumpled leaves, which are easily distinguished from
those of the preceding Period.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon in this Period to find the arch mouldings continued,
without the intervention of impost or capital, down to the ground; or,
inversely, the mouldings of the piers carried uninterruptedly upwards
through the arch. This is the case as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> well in the arches of the
Ground-story, as in the windows and doorways.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Triforium</span> rarely occurs in its full proportions, and in such cases
exhibits the usual window tracery of the Period: it oftener consists of
a panel enclosed within the prolonged jambs of the Clere-story window,
and is sometimes reduced to a row of quatrefoils.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Clere-story</span> has its inner arch sometimes foliated, but oftener the
window is flush with the face of the inner wall, and the gallery is
omitted.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Vaulting</span> exhibits much more intricacy; and a variety of ribs
generally intersect the surface of the different cells.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Aisle-arcade</span> is not often seen.</p>

RECTILINEAR PERIOD.</h2>
<hr class="r5" />

<h3>PRINCIPAL CHARACTERISTIC.</h3>

<p class="center">THE PREVALENCE OF STRAIGHT LINKS, BOTH HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL, IN THE
TRACERY OF WINDOWS, IN PANELS AND ARCADES.</p>


<h4><i>Exterior Compartment.</i></h4>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Walls</span> and <span class="smcap">Buttresses</span> of this Period present great contrasts, being
generally perfectly plain, but occasionally, in the richer buildings,
completely covered with rectangular panelling.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Base-course</span> is often deep, rises in several stages, and contains a
few large bold mouldings.</p>

<p>The mullions of the <span class="smcap">Windows</span> almost invariably rise vertically through
the Tracery, and are often crossed at right angles by other straight
lines, as well in the lower part of the Window as in the Tracery
itself.</p>

<p>These <i>Transoms</i> in some of the larger East and West Windows, occurring
at equal intervals, divide the entire design into a series of
rectangular compartments, and give to the whole the appearance of a
huge gridiron. They are sometimes ornamented with a small battlemented
moulding.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Clere-story Windows</span>, as well as the side windows, where the aisle
walls are low, are often square-headed.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Cornice</span> generally carries a large shallow hollow, filled at
intervals with a square flat leaf, and grotesque sculptures.
<i>Gurgoyles</i>, formed usually of the head and shoulders of some monster,
and projecting from the cornice, for the purpose of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> carrying the water
from the gutters clear of the walls, which occur in the former Period,
are now universal.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Parapets</span> are frequently ornamented richly, with rectangular
foliated panelling, and covered with a <span class="smcap">Battlement</span>. Both are sometimes
pierced instead of being panelled.</p>


<h4><i>Interior Compartment.</i></h4>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Piers</span> are usually tall and light, and consist generally, as in the
preceding Period, of four shafts with intervening hollows, which latter
are continued uninterruptedly round the Pier-arch.</p>

<p>Frequently the entire Pier is moulded without shafts, and the whole of
the mouldings are carried round the Pier-arch.</p>

<p>The Pier is frequently so disposed that its transverse section is
greater than its longitudinal section, or, in other words, it is
thicker from North to South than it is from East to West.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Capitals</span> are usually octagonal, but sometimes circular. Foliage is
much more rarely seen in their hollows, and they contain plain
mouldings of a more angular character generally than in the preceding
Period. They are also taller, in comparison, to their diameter. They
have sometimes a battlement moulding on their upper edge, which is in
other cases often square.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Bases</span> are generally tall, narrow, and polygonal, and often of
several stages.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Pier-arches</span> occasionally a form occurs for the first time, which
is seen in no other Period. This is the <i>four-centered</i> arch, so called
from the circumstance of its being drawn from four different centres:
its use, however, in <i>arches of construction</i>, except in the Vaulting,
is by no means so common as in <i>arches of decoration</i>, where it
continually appears. It is often enclosed in doorways, under a square
head. The mouldings of Pier-arches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> Window-arches, and all others are
usually plain, broad, and shallow; the double Ogee occurs continually,
as well as a large shallow hollow, drawn from three centres, between a
few small filleted members. Few Arches carry more than two orders.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">String-courses</span>, <span class="smcap">Cornices</span>, and other hollow mouldings, flat
square leaves at intervals, continuous training foliage, and the
vine-leaf and grapes, frequently occur; but the relief is usually not
considerable, and the amount of undercutting in foliage exhibited in
the two previous Periods is never seen. The Tudor Rose and the Tudor
Flower are frequent ornaments of this Period.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Triforium</span> is rarely seen, and in its place the Clere-story Window
is often carried down in blank panelling to the passage or
String-course over the Pier-arches. It is sometimes, however,
represented by a band of panelling or pierced work.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Clere-story</span> attains considerable height and importance in this
Period; the effect of which, in large buildings, is increased by the
suppression of the Triforium, and the substitution in its place of the
apparent continuation downwards of the Clere-story. In many buildings
the Clere-story windows are in pairs, and so numerous that all blank
wall entirely disappears; and the effect of the mass of light thus
poured down into the Church is very striking and characteristic.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Vaulting</span> becomes much more complicated and enriched in this Period.
Diverging ribs having bosses and shields at their points of
intersection, cover the surface of the Vault: the plans of these
vaultings are very various: some are called <i>Fan-tracery</i> vaults, and
others <i>Stellar</i> vaults, terms which explain themselves.</p>

<p>Open wooden roofs of elaborate construction, and large span, become
common in this Period. They spring frequently from Corbel shafts,
resting on figures in the Clere-story wall; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> have rich cornices of
mouldings and carved work, traceried spandrels, figures of angels, and
richly moulded beams. The <span class="smcap">Aisle-arcade</span> is not often found, but its
place is sometimes supplied by the rectangular surface panelling, so
characteristic of the Period, which in some of the richer buildings
literally covers the whole of the walls, leaving no blank or unoccupied
space.</p>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
